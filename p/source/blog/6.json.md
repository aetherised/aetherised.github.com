In the desert<br/>
I saw a creature, naked, bestial,<br/>
Who, squatting upon the ground,<br/>
Held his heart in his hands,<br/>
And ate of it.<br/>
I said, &ldquo;Is it good, friend?&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;It is bitterâ€”bitter,&rdquo; he answered;

&ldquo;But I like it<br/>
&ldquo;Because it is bitter,<br/>
&ldquo;And because it is my heart.&rdquo;
