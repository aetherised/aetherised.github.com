down. translated. is the personal blog of @aetherised. here you will find musings, sketches, works in progress and other miscellanae of interest to no one at all. _it's a blog, after all._

@aetherised also runs a somewhat more respectable blog, "the neomodernist", as a currated collection of artifacts and commentary from antiquity to the late modern period &mdash; please visit.
