Stephen Crane is better known as the author of _The Red Badge of Courage_. Although his poetry with was initially met with derision, Crane himself preferred his &ldquo;little book of poems&rdquo; to his more famous novel &mdash; saying that with _The Black Riders_, &ldquo;my aim was to comprehend in it the thoughts I have had about life in general, while &rsquo;The Red Badge&lsquo; is a mere episode in life, an amplification.&rdquo;

In the desert<br/>
I saw a creature, naked, bestial,<br/>
Who, squatting upon the ground,<br/>
Held his heart in his hands,<br/>
And ate of it.<br/>
I said, &ldquo;Is it good, friend?&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;It is bitterâ€”bitter,&rdquo; he answered;

&ldquo;But I like it<br/>
&ldquo;Because it is bitter,<br/>
&ldquo;And because it is my heart.&rdquo;
