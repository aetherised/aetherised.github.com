<h3 id="meet-your-tutor-george-hallahan">Meet your tutor, George Hallahan</h3>
<p>Quite simply, I got to write my first computer program in 1966. Totally hooked, I went to
work at 22 years old for IBM and I&#39;ve made it a priority to stay &quot;technologically
current&quot; ever since. I now enjoy sharing what I know with my &quot;students&quot; &mdash; and it
works! It really does!</p>
<p>Having worked with various aspects of high technology for many years &mdash; everything
from the mainframe computers of the 1960s to today&#39;s smartphones, laptops, and PCs
&mdash; I have a true appreciation of just how daunting it is to master even a tiny
percentage of what there is to be learned. It&#39;s humbling, but it&#39;s also exhilarating. I
was one of the first people to really learn &quot;Word Processing&quot; and what I remember most is
the feeling of empowerment I experienced. I realized I could easily do the work of
six or seven people by leveraging the power of just that one breakthrough technology. I
remember my first personal color printer &mdash; what a breakthrough that was. Now, with
smart phones, tablets and global internet connectivity, the sky&#39;s the limit &mdash; it
truly is. Technology, if mastered, can dramatically enhance your quality of life, freeing
up time for you to savor and enjoy it. <em>Wow!!</em></p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-very-simple-actually-">How does it work? Very simple, actually:</h3>
<p>You give me a call, ask a few questions, whatever. We make an appointment at your place,
the library, a coffee shop or wherever is convenient for you, and we discuss what you
you want to accomplish. In addition, I&#39;ll show you some of the ways I myself use these
tech tools, some of which are truly amazing, and save me thousands and thousands of
$$$ and hours and hours of precious time every single year.</p>
