      <h3>Meet your tutor, George Hallahan</h3>
      <p>
        Quite simply, I got to write my first computer program in 1966. Totally hooked, I went to work at 22 for IBM and made it a priority to "technologically current" ever since. I now enjoy sharing what I know with my "students" - and it works! It really does!
      </p>

        After working with various and sundry aspects of high technology for years and years and years, I have a true appreciation of just how daunting it is to master even a tiny percentage of what there is to be learned. It's humbling, but it's also exhilarating. As one of the first people to really learn "Word Processing" I remember the feeling of empowerment I experienced when I realized I could do the work of six or seven people by leveraging the power of just that simple technology. I remember my first color printer - what a breakthrough that was. Now, with smart phones, tablets and global internet connectivity, the sky's the limit - it truly is.

      <h3>How does it work? Very simple, actually.</h3>
      <p>
        You give me a call, ask a few questions, whatever. We make an appointment, your place, the library, a coffee shop and we discuss what you think you might want to accomplish. In addition, I'll show you some of the things I do with a whole bunch of different things, some of which are truly amazing, and some save me thousands and thousands of $$$ every single year.
